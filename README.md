===============

Scripts and small tools that I write to make my life easier.

To install the scripts in their last version in ~/bin:

    chmod +x deploy.sh && bash deploy.sh

The repository contains:

* publish-it: a bash script that exports documents in PDF referencing
  them with their git commit sha and date.
* More to come...
